# 100 Days Of Code Log

### Day 0: May 7th, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I created repositories for the two projects I will start with and initialized them with the following:

* https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app
* https://nuxtjs.org/

**Thoughts:** Okay React isn't as evil as I thought and is more similar to Vue.js than I thought! I am starting with Nuxt.js instead of Vue.js, because I already have experience with Vue.js on a few projects and want to use Nuxt.js for a specific project.


### Day 1: May 8th, 2019

* [Implemented](https://github.com/sodevious/nicoledominguez-nuxt/commit/2fcc04c96d53d05d7593f4e9373ece2166076d7e) [nuxt-fontawesome](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nuxt-fontawesome) into my project. I feel like Nuxt ports of Vue packages are not as well documented about usage, which may have different syntax. Annoying. 

* [Implemented](https://github.com/sodevious/nicoledominguez-nuxt/commit/b74d2e0416ea525f947ef037150d4f6ee9cd432c) PostCSS and Autoprefixer.

* My Nuxt project is going to be refactoring/porting my personal website from a static Jekyll site into Nuxt. I have a feeling that the Nuxt version will be heavier and less performant.

### Day 2: May 9th, 2019

* [Created](https://github.com/sodevious/nicoledominguez-nuxt/commit/cd809afb9ec423667c00dc6d98950905ba4aafa0) a `<Button>` component.
