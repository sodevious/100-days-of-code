# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 7th, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I created repositories for the two projects I will start with and initialized them with the following:

* https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app
* https://nuxtjs.org/

**Thoughts:** Okay React isn't as evil as I thought and is more similar to Vue.js than I thought! I am starting with Nuxt.js instead of Vue.js, because I already have experience with Vue.js on a few projects and want to use Nuxt.js for a specific project.
